# K-PERL : Personalized Response Generation Using Persona-Adapted Query and Dynamic Knowledge Retrieval
Personalizing conversational agents can enhance the quality of conversations and increase user engagement. However, they often lack external knowledge to appropriately tend to a
userâ€™s persona. To enhance the relevance and
comprehensiveness of personalized responses, we propose using a two-step approach that involves: 
(1) selectively integrating user personas and 
(2) contextualizing the response with meta information from a background knowledge source. 
We develop *K*-**PERL** (**K**nowledge guided **PE**rsonalization of response generation
with **R**einforcement **L**earning), a dynamic conversational agent that combines these elements.
K-PERL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the popular FoCus dataset, containing real-world personalized conversations concerning
global landmarks. Finally, we show that using responses from K-PERL can improve performance in state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT 3.5) by
10.5%. These results highlight the impact of KPERL for personalizing chatbots effectively.
