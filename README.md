# K-PERM: Personalized Response Generation Using Dynamic Knowledge Retrieval and Persona-Adaptive Queries

Personalizing conversational agents can
enhance the quality of conversations and
increase user engagement. However, they often
lack external knowledge to appropriately tend
to a userâ€™s persona. This is particularly crucial
for practical applications like mental health
support, nutrition planning, culturally sensitive
conversations, or reducing toxic behavior in
conversational agents. To enhance the relevance and comprehensiveness of personalized
responses, we propose using a two-step approach that involves (1) selectively integrating
user personas and (2) contextualizing the
response with supplementing information
from a background knowledge source. We
develop *K*-**PERM** (*K*nowledge-guided
**PE**rsonalization with **R**eward **M**odulation), a
dynamic conversational agent that combines
these elements. K-PERM achieves state-of-the-
art performance on the popular FoCus dataset,
containing real-world personalized conversations concerning global landmarks. We
show that using responses from K-PERM can
improve performance in state-of-the-art LLMs
(GPT 3.5) by 10.5%, highlighting the impact of
K-PERM for personalizing chatbots.
